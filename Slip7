Slip no 7 
Question 1. Write a java program that implements a multi-thread application that has three threads. 
First thread generates random integer number after every one second, if the number is even; 
second thread computes the square of that number and print it. If the number is odd, the third 
thread computes the of cube of that number and print it.
import java.util.Random;
class Slip7 implements Runnable {
    public void run() {
        Random r = new Random();
        while (true) {
            int num = r.nextInt(100);
            System.out.println("\nGenerated Number: " + num);
            if (num % 2 == 0) {
                System.out.println("Square of " + num + " = " + (num * num));
            } else {
                System.out.println("Cube of " + num + " = " + (num * num * num));
            }
            try {
                Thread.sleep(100); 
            } catch (Exception e) {
                System.out.println(e);
            }}}

public static void main(String[] args) {
    Thread t1 = new Thread(new Slip7());
    t1.start();   } }
